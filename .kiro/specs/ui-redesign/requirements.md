# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the visual appearance of the Post Quantum Lattice Shield website to create a modern, dark-themed interface that better reflects the advanced cryptographic technology. The redesign will incorporate contemporary design elements including Google Fonts, aurora-style borders, and an animated 3D lattice background that visually represents the lattice-based cryptography concept.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the website, I want to see a modern dark-themed interface that reflects the cutting-edge nature of post-quantum cryptography, so that I feel confident in the technology's sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a dark background theme with high contrast text
2. WHEN viewing any section THEN the system SHALL use Red Hat Display font with weights 300 and 800 for proper typography hierarchy
3. WHEN viewing text content THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
4. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL display purple/indigo/teal aurora-style borders on key elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor interested in lattice-based cryptography, I want to see a visual representation of the lattice concept in the background, so that I can immediately understand the connection to the technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3D lattice matrix background with equally spaced points
2. WHEN viewing the background THEN the system SHALL show some lattice points connected by lines to create a network effect
3. WHEN the page is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the background lattice is subtle enough not to interfere with text readability
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the lattice pattern proportionally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating the website, I want interactive visual elements that respond to my actions, so that the interface feels modern and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL display aurora border animations
2. WHEN scrolling through sections THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across all components
3. WHEN viewing cards and buttons THEN the system SHALL apply consistent aurora styling effects
4. WHEN interacting with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user accessing the website on various devices, I want the new design to work seamlessly across all screen sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain the dark theme and typography hierarchy
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the lattice background appropriately
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display the full 3D lattice effect
4. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency and readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or technical user, I want the redesigned interface to maintain all existing functionality while improving the visual presentation, so that I can still access all features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any existing functionality THEN the system SHALL preserve all current features and interactions
2. WHEN viewing API documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain code readability with appropriate dark theme syntax highlighting
3. WHEN downloading the plugin THEN the system SHALL keep all existing download functionality intact
4. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and anchor link behavior
