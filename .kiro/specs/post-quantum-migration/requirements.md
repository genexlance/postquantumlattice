# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Post Quantum Lattice Shield system uses traditional RSA encryption despite being marketed as post-quantum ready. This feature will migrate the system to use genuine post-quantum cryptography via the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library, implementing ML-KEM-512 (formerly Kyber-512) for key encapsulation and AES-256-GCM for data encryption. The system must maintain backward compatibility during the transition while providing quantum-resistant security for WordPress form data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress site administrator, I want my form encryption to be truly quantum-resistant, so that my users' sensitive data remains secure even against future quantum computer attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates keypairs THEN it SHALL use ML-KEM-512 algorithm from the Open Quantum Safe library
2. WHEN form data is encrypted THEN it SHALL use ML-KEM-512 for key encapsulation and AES-256-GCM for data encryption
3. WHEN the system processes encryption requests THEN it SHALL verify the OQS library is properly loaded and functional
4. IF the OQS library fails to load THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message and not fall back to RSA

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the microservice, I want proper error handling and logging for the OQS integration, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix any quantum cryptography issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OQS operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages including operation type and failure reason
2. WHEN keypair generation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with specific error details
3. WHEN encryption/decryption operations fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between OQS errors and data format errors
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify OQS library availability and log the verification result

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin user, I want seamless migration from RSA to post-quantum encryption, so that existing encrypted data remains accessible while new data uses quantum-resistant protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin detects existing RSA keys THEN it SHALL offer to migrate to ML-KEM-512 keys
2. WHEN decrypting data THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether data was encrypted with RSA or ML-KEM and use the appropriate decryption method
3. WHEN migration is initiated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing RSA keys as backup until migration is confirmed successful
4. WHEN new keys are generated THEN they SHALL be ML-KEM-512 keys by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want to verify that post-quantum encryption is working correctly, so that I can be confident in the system's quantum resistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin runs encryption tests THEN the system SHALL display the specific algorithm being used (ML-KEM-512 + AES-256-GCM)
2. WHEN viewing system status THEN the admin SHALL see confirmation that OQS library is loaded and functional
3. WHEN generating test data THEN the system SHALL demonstrate successful round-trip encryption/decryption using post-quantum algorithms
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL include algorithm information in API responses for verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Netlify functions to properly handle OQS library dependencies, so that the post-quantum encryption works reliably in the serverless environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Netlify functions are deployed THEN they SHALL include the OQS library as a properly bundled dependency
2. WHEN functions initialize THEN they SHALL verify OQS library compatibility with the Node.js runtime
3. WHEN memory or performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the OQS library is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing encrypted data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress form user, I want my form submissions to be encrypted with post-quantum algorithms transparently, so that I don't need to change my behavior while gaining quantum-resistant protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a form with encrypted fields THEN the data SHALL be encrypted using ML-KEM-512 + AES-256-GCM without user intervention
2. WHEN form submission completes THEN the user SHALL receive the same confirmation experience as before
3. WHEN encryption fails THEN the user SHALL see a clear error message without technical details
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN post-quantum encryption SHALL not significantly impact form submission performance
