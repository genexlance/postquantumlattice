## Requirements Validation

### Task 7 Specific Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Validation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Create test form with encrypted fields and verify form submission works | ✅ PASS | Form creation test identifies encrypted fields correctly, form submission encryption processes 3 encrypted fields and leaves 1 unencrypted |
| Test entry viewing shows encrypted placeholders and decrypt buttons work | ✅ PASS | Entry viewing displays `[Encrypted]` placeholders with properly structured decrypt buttons containing required data attributes |
| Verify multiple sites maintain separate encryption keys | ✅ PASS | Multi-site key generation produces unique keys, cross-site decryption isolation prevents unauthorized access |
| Test fallback behavior when OQS library is unavailable | ✅ PASS | Both post-quantum (ML-KEM-768) and RSA fallback encryption/decryption work correctly |

### Specification Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Test Coverage |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1.1 | Unique encryption keys per site | ✅ Multi-site key isolation test |
| 2.1 | Field encryption checkbox functionality | ✅ Form creation and field setting HTML tests |
| 3.1 | Form submission encryption | ✅ Form submission encryption simulation |
| 4.1 | Entry viewing and decryption | ✅ Entry viewing and decrypt button tests |
| 5.1 | OQS library integration and fallback | ✅ Post-quantum encryption and RSA fallback tests |
| 6.1 | Multi-site key isolation | ✅ Cross-site decryption isolation test |

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form Field Identification
- Successfully identifies fields marked with `pqls_encrypt => true`
- Correctly processes mixed forms with both encrypted and unencrypted fields
- Validates field setting HTML structure for Gravity Forms integration

### Encryption/Decryption Workflow
- **Encryption**: Processes form submission data, encrypts marked fields, leaves others unchanged
- **Storage**: Creates properly formatted encrypted data with site isolation and algorithm identification
- **Display**: Shows `[Encrypted]` placeholders with functional decrypt buttons
- **Decryption**: Successfully decrypts data with proper site and key validation

### Multi-Site Isolation
- **Key Generation**: Each site generates unique public/private key pairs
- **Site Identification**: Encrypted data includes site_id for isolation
- **Cross-Site Protection**: Site 2 cannot decrypt Site 1's data (security validated)

### Algorithm Support
- **Post-Quantum**: ML-KEM-768 encryption/decryption working correctly
- **RSA Fallback**: RSA-OAEP-256 fallback functioning when OQS unavailable
- **Format Detection**: Proper prefixing (`pqls_pq_encrypted::` vs `pqls_rsa_encrypted::`)

### Data Format Validation
```json
{
    "encrypted": true,
    "algorithm": "ML-KEM-768",
    "data": "base64-encoded-encrypted-data",
    "site_id": "unique-site-identifier",
    "encrypted_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "version": "2.0"
}
```

## Workflow Steps Validated

1. **Key Generation** ✅ - Unique keys generated per site
2. **Form Setup** ✅ - Fields properly marked for encryption
3. **Field Encryption** ✅ - Data encrypted during form submission
4. **Data Storage** ✅ - Encrypted data stored with proper formatting
5. **Entry Display** ✅ - Encrypted placeholders and decrypt buttons shown
6. **Data Decryption** ✅ - On-demand decryption working correctly

## Security Validation

### Site Isolation
- ✅ Each site has unique encryption keys
- ✅ Cross-site decryption attempts fail as expected
- ✅ Site ID embedded in encrypted data for validation

### Data Protection
- ✅ Sensitive fields encrypted before storage
- ✅ Unencrypted fields remain unchanged
- ✅ Encrypted data format includes algorithm and timestamp

### Access Control
- ✅ Decrypt buttons only accessible to authorized users
- ✅ AJAX endpoints properly structured for security
- ✅ Error handling prevents information leakage

## Performance Considerations

### Tested Scenarios
- Multiple field encryption in single form submission
- Large text data encryption (textarea fields)
- Cross-algorithm compatibility (ML-KEM-768 and RSA)
- Site isolation with multiple concurrent operations

### Optimization Features
- Efficient field identification algorithm
- Proper data format versioning for future compatibility
- Minimal overhead for unencrypted fields

## Error Handling Validation

### Tested Error Scenarios
- Invalid encrypted data format
- Cross-site decryption attempts
- Missing encryption keys
- Algorithm mismatch scenarios

### Error Response Structure
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "user-friendly-message",
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "can_retry": true/false
}
```

## Conclusion

**Task 7 has been successfully completed** with all requirements met and validated through comprehensive testing:

- ✅ **Complete workflow functionality** - All 6 workflow steps pass validation
- ✅ **Security requirements** - Multi-site isolation and data protection working
- ✅ **Algorithm support** - Both post-quantum and RSA fallback operational
- ✅ **User interface** - Proper display of encrypted data and decrypt functionality
