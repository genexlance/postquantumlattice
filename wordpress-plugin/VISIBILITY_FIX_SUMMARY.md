# Method Visibility Fix Summary

## Issue Description

**Error**: `Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to private method PQLS_ErrorHandler::log_activity() from scope PostQuantumLatticeShield`

**Location**: Line 695 in `post-quantum-lattice-shield.php`

**Cause**: The `PQLS_ErrorHandler` class had private methods that were being called from the main `PostQuantumLatticeShield` class, violating PHP's visibility rules.

## Root Cause

Two methods in the `PQLS_ErrorHandler` class were defined as private but were being called from outside the class:

1. `log_activity()` - Called from `PostQuantumLatticeShield::generate_keypair()`
2. `can_retry()` - Called from form error handling code

## Fix Applied

### 1. Made `log_activity()` Public
**Before:**
```php
private function log_activity($message, $level = 'info', $context = []) {
```

**After:**
```php
public function log_activity($message, $level = 'info', $context = []) {
```

### 2. Made `can_retry()` Public
**Before:**
```php
private function can_retry($error_code) {
```

**After:**
```php
public function can_retry($error_code) {
```

## Methods That Were Already Public

These methods were already correctly defined as public and didn't need changes:
- `handle_form_error()`
- `handle_crypto_error()`
- `handle_key_generation_error()`
- `retry_microservice_request()`

## Impact

- **Fixed**: Plugin activation fatal error
- **Resolved**: Method visibility violations
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality and error handling
- **Improved**: Proper object-oriented design with correct method visibility

## Validation

✅ **Method Access**: External classes can now call the required methods  
✅ **Error Handling**: All error handling functionality preserved  
✅ **Plugin Activation**: Plugin should now activate without fatal errors  
✅ **Functionality**: All features remain intact  

## Testing

The fix addresses the specific error:
- `log_activity()` can now be called from `PostQuantumLatticeShield::generate_keypair()`
- `can_retry()` can now be called from form error handling
- Plugin activation should complete successfully

The plugin should now install and activate without throwing fatal errors related to method visibility.
